## Module Versioning
This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/).

Using the given version number of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we apply the following constructs:
1) Use the `MAJOR` version for incompatible changes.
2) Use the `MINOR` version when adding functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
3) Use the `PATCH` version when introducing backwards compatible bug fixes.

#### Backwards compatibility in `0.0.z` and `0.y.z` version
- In the context of initial development, backwards compatibility in versions `0.0.z` is **not guaranteed** when `z` is 
  increased. (Initial development)
- In the context of pre-release, backwards compatibility in versions `0.y.z` is **not guaranteed** when `y` is
increased. (Pre-release)
